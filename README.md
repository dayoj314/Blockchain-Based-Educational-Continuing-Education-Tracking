# Blockchain-Based Continuing Education Tracking

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain solution for tracking continuing education requirements for professionals across various industries. By leveraging smart contracts, the system provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof record of professional development activities, ensuring integrity in credential verification and regulatory compliance.

## Key Components

### Professional Verification Contract
- Validates the identity of licensed practitioners
- Maintains cryptographic proof of professional credentials
- Links professionals to their licensing bodies and specializations
- Implements privacy controls for sensitive practitioner information
- Supports credential verification without exposing personal data

### Course Verification Contract
- Confirms the legitimacy of educational offerings and providers
- Stores course metadata including content, duration, and accreditation
- Validates course completion requirements and assessment standards
- Implements provider reputation systems and quality metrics
- Prevents counterfeit or unaccredited course listings

### Credit Tracking Contract
- Records completed professional development activities
- Implements standardized credit calculation across different professions
- Maintains immutable history of earned continuing education units
- Supports different credit types (e.g., ethics, clinical, technical)
- Enables automatic credit issuance upon verified course completion

### Compliance Monitoring Contract
- Ensures fulfillment of licensing and certification requirements
- Tracks progress toward periodic continuing education mandates
- Implements deadline management and renewal notifications
- Provides verification interfaces for regulatory bodies
- Generates audit-ready compliance reports

## Getting Started
